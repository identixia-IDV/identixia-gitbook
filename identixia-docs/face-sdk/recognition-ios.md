# Face Recognition SDK for iOS


## Overview

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Repository** | [`FaceRecognition-iOS`](https://github.com/identixia-IDV/FaceRecognition-iOS) · [Releases](https://github.com/identixia-IDV/FaceRecognition-iOS/releases/latest) |
| **Platform** | iOS |
| **Runs** | On the device. Images stay in the app. |

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Face detection | Bounding box, landmarks, and pose |
| Attributes | Age, gender, and related traits when enabled |
| Quality | ICAO-style image and face quality scores |
| Templates | Numerical representations of faces that you can store in **your** database for comparison |
| 1:1 match | Compare two images or two templates |
| 1:N identify | Enroll a gallery and search. This sample does not return a liveness score. |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| IDE | Xcode (recent stable) |
| Device | Physical iPhone for camera demos |
| Deployment | iOS 13+ (see sample project) |
| Frameworks | Vendored `.framework` / `.xcframework` from Release or Drive pack |

## Download and place the runtime

Download the native SDK libraries and model files before running the sample. Use `scripts/get_runtime.py` to retrieve the required GitHub Release assets and place them in the sample's expected folders.

### Download (recommended)

```bash
python scripts/get_runtime.py
```

To pin a specific Release tag:

```bash
python scripts/get_runtime.py --tag 1.0.0
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Release asset** | `facerecognitionsdk-ios.zip` (frameworks + `databases/*.xdb`) |
| **Local path after download** | Repository root / `Frameworks/` + `databases/*.xdb` |
| **Databases** | Place every `*.xdb` from the Release next to the frameworks (or under `databases/`). |

### Manual download (optional)

Open the repository **Releases** page and download the asset named above:

```text
https://github.com/identixia-IDV/FaceRecognition-iOS/releases/latest/download/<asset>
```

Extract the archive directly into the documented folder. Check that the library and model files are not inside an additional nested directory.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If databases are missing, activate/init may succeed but recognition, liveness, or OCR will fail at runtime. `get_runtime.py` checks required packs after download.
{% endhint %}

## Integration guide — start the project

### 1. Clone the sample

```bash
git clone https://github.com/identixia-IDV/FaceRecognition-iOS.git
cd FaceRecognition-iOS
```

### 2. Download and place the runtime

See [Download and place the runtime](#download-and-place-the-runtime) below. From the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/get_runtime.py
```

### 3. Run the demo

Open the Xcode project, set your signing **Team**, and run on a physical iPhone.

Wait until Home status shows **Ready** before opening camera modes.

### 4. Activate and try every mode

1. Confirm Home / About shows a licensed **Ready** state (sample apps ship a demo key for the sample application id only).
2. Exercise each demo tile once (enroll, identify, capture, attribute, liveness, document front/back, result).
3. For your own app: request a license for **your** application id / bundle id, then call activate → init on a background thread.


## License and activation (mobile)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Demo id** | Sample application / bundle id in the repository |
| **Demo key** | Bundled for the sample id only |
| **Your app** | New applicationId / bundle id → request a new license |

### Activate → init (concept)

1. Call activate with your license string (background thread).
2. On success, call init (unpacks on-device models; may take a few seconds the first time).
3. Gate UI on Ready / license status before camera modes.
4. Never paste the demo key into a production app id.


### Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | ------- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` / `-1` | Invalid license |
| `2` / `-2` | Wrong application / bundle id |
| `3` / `-3` | License expired |
| `4` / `-4` | Not activated |
| `-5` | Init / model load failed |
| `-10` | Invalid argument |
| `-11` | Invalid image |
| `-12` | No face |
| `-13` | No document |
| `-16` | Liveness failed (when gated) |

Run native SDK calls sequentially on **one background thread**. The engine does not support simultaneous calls.


## API reference — mobile face SDK

This repository does not include face liveness. Do not call `liveness` or `/api/face/liveness`.

Prefer **`FaceRecognitionClient`** (Android kit) / the matching iOS kit wrappers. Flutter, React Native, and Ionic expose the **same method names** as Android (`detect`, `faceDetection`, `match`, …). Serialize all engine calls on **one background thread**.

### Lifecycle

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `setActivation(license)` / kit `activate(license)` | Activate (+ init) on a worker thread |
| `init()` | Load models when not bundled into activate |
| `deinit()` / `deactivate()` / `release()` | Tear down engine |
| `getMachineCode()` | Offline machine / app fingerprint helpers |
| `getLicenseStatus()` | Current license flags |
| `allowsRecognition()` / `allowsLiveness()` | Capability checks |

### Still-image recognition

| API | Purpose | Closest HTTP route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detect(image, crop?, flags?)` | Detect faces; JSON with regions / landmarks / traits | `POST /api/face/analyze` |
| `faceDetection(image, param?)` | Typed `FaceBox` list / JSON boxes | `POST /api/face/boxes` |
| `faceDetect` / `faceAttribute` / `imageQuality` / `landmarks` | Focused still helpers (plugin channels) | `/api/face/traits`, `/image-quality`, `/landmarks` |
| `match(image1, image2)` | 1:1 image compare | `POST /api/face/compare` |
| `templateExtraction(image, face)` | Template bytes for one face box | `POST /api/face/template` |
| `extractFeature(image)` | Feature bytes (largest / primary face) | `POST /api/face/template` |
| `similarity(feature1, feature2)` | 1:1 score between templates | `POST /api/face/score` |
| `quality(image, crop?)` | Quality attributes JSON | `POST /api/face/quality` |
| `setLandmarkMode(14\|68)` | Landmark density | — |

### Gallery (on-device 1:N)

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enroll(name, feature, thumbnail?)` | Store person locally |
| `bestMatch(feature, threshold)` | 1:N search |
| `enrolledPeople()` / `removeEnrolled` / `clearEnrolled` | Gallery management |
| `syncDatabase(matchThreshold)` | Push templates into VideoWorker DB |

### Live camera (VideoWorker)

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `startVideoWorker(config)` | Start tracking / identify session |
| `addFrame` / live-frame helpers | Push camera frames |
| `setVideoWorkerEventHandler` | Receive track / match events (JSON) |
| `stopVideoWorker()` | Stop session |
| `makeTrackingConfig` / `makeIdentityConfig` | Build configs |

### Usage example (Android kit)

```kotlin
val client = FaceRecognitionClient.get(context)
client.activate(licenseKey) { code ->
    if (code != 0) return@activate
    // Worker thread: detect + match
    val json = client.detect(bitmap, /* crop */ false, /* flags */ 0)
    val score = client.match(bitmapA, bitmapB)
}
```

### Usage example (plugin / Flutter / React Native / Ionic)

Call the same method names exposed by the plugin bridge (`activate` → `init` → `detect` / `match` / `enroll`). Keep camera preview on the UI thread; keep engine calls on a single background isolate / queue.

### Integration checklist

1. Download runtime with `python scripts/get_runtime.py` (or `install.gradle` on Android).
2. `FaceRecognitionClient.get(context).activate(license) { code -> … }` (or `setActivation` → `init` on plugins).
3. On `0`, enable camera modes.
4. Enroll → Identify, or Capture / Attribute for still flows.
5. Persist templates in **your** database if you leave the demo gallery.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid license | Application / bundle id must match the key; server needs the correct machine code |
| Init failed | Runtime AAR/framework/`lib` missing or wrong ABI |
| No face / no document | Lighting, crop, distance; try still gallery image first |
| Liveness / authenticity empty | License flag off — request the matching entitlement |
| Camera black / crash | Use a **physical** device; grant camera permission |
| Docker license fails after bare-metal license | Machine codes differ — re-license the container |
